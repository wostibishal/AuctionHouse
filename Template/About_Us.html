        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At Auction House, our mission is to create an accessible and user-friendly online auction platform that celebrates and preserves Nepal's rich cultural heritage. We aim to provide a marketplace where users can buy, sell, and appreciate historical artifacts, arts, and crafts, as well as everyday items, fostering a deeper understanding and respect for our cultural legacy.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Story</h2>

Our platform addresses these issues by offering a tailored solution that meets the specific demands of our community.</p>
